# Docker Stack with Traefik, Twingate, Ngrok, Nginx, CrowdStrike, and Firewall Containers

This Docker stack provides a comprehensive solution for network management, security, and traffic routing in your environment. It includes several containers configured to work together seamlessly.

## Containers Included:

### 1. Traefik
- Traefik is a modern reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.

### 2. Twingate
- Twingate provides Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions, allowing secure remote access to resources without exposing them to the public internet.

### 3. Ngrok
- Ngrok creates secure tunnels to localhost, which are helpful for exposing local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet.

### 4. Nginx
- Nginx is a powerful web server and reverse proxy that handles incoming HTTP requests.

### 5. CrowdStrike
- CrowdStrike provides endpoint security and threat intelligence services to protect your systems from cyber threats.

### 6. Firewall Containers
- These containers can be used to implement firewall rules and can be locked down remotely in emergencies.

## Usage:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.

2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd docker-stack
    ```

4. Adjust the configurations in the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your requirements. Ensure that you provide necessary environment variables and volume mounts.

5. Start the Docker stack using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

6. Access the services via their respective endpoints. Ensure that ports are exposed properly and accessible as required.

## Notes:

- Make sure to configure each container properly according to your specific use case and security requirements.

- Consider implementing additional security measures such as authentication, encryption, and access controls as needed.

- Regularly update the containers and their dependencies to ensure that you are protected against known vulnerabilities.

- Monitor the performance and security of your Docker stack continuously to identify and address any issues promptly.

- In emergencies, you can remotely lock down the firewall containers to restrict access and mitigate potential threats.

# Twingate Setup - Optional

### What is Twingate?
Twingate is a cloud-based network security platform that provides secure access to private networks, cloud applications, and other resources for remote workers and contractors. Twingate uses a zero-trust model to authenticate users and devices and enforce granular access policies for each resource, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources based on their role, device, location, and other factors. 

Twingate uses software components called "Connectors" to provide secure access to private networks and cloud resources without requiring a VPN or opening ports on firewalls. Twingate also provides centralized visibility and control over user activity and resource access across multiple environments, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. 

<br> 

### Create a Twingate network:   
In twingate a 'network' is a logical container that represents the network of resources you want to secure. You can create a network by logging in to your Twingate account and navigating to the Networks page. Click on the "Create Network" button and follow the steps to create a new network.  

<br> 

### Set up a Connector:   
A Twingate connector is a software component that allows your Docker Compose application to securely connect to your Twingate network. You can set up a Connector by navigating to the Connectors page and clicking on the "Add Connector" button. Follow the steps to set up a Connector and make sure to note the Connector's ID and Secret.  

<br> 

### Setting up a Resource in Twingate:   
This involves creating an access policy that defines the conditions under which users can access the resource.  
Navigate to the Resources page on the Twingate web console and click "Add Resource". Provide the necessary details for the resource, including the IP address, hostname, or URL.
The address of the docker services is simply their name i.e. the kali service address is 'kali', you can then set the name and URL to whatever you would like.
Next, create an access policy for the resource by clicking "Add Access Policy". Specify the users or groups that should have access to the resource, and configure any additional conditions, such as time of day or location. Once you have configured the access policy, save it and activate it.   

<br>   

### Build and Run With docker:   
You will need to add environment variables that provide the Twingate Connector configuration details. These variables include the Connector ID, Connector Secret, and the name of your Twingate network. The resource is now set up and ready for users to access securely through the Twingate network.  

<br> 

### Connect your Docker Compose Application to Twingate:   
Finally you can download the Twingate client and log in and select the network you created in step 1. Once signed in you can use the alias set when setting up the resource such as my_network.int to access the resource, try entering the alias into the browser.
